# NeuroPong

Neuro Pong is a small project based on genetic algorithm, the idea behind this project was to learn about neural network. 
The project was made in java using Processing an opensource IDE. The whole project was object-based.
The game is based on the pong game from the Atri, the Ai don't play exactly the same game has the real one but one who doesn't need 2 players.

As seen on this picture, multiple instance of the same game is generated, creating a generation of individual Ai. Each Ai is represented by its own colour.
